But ARM, which is trying to harness the enthusiasm behind its own RISC architecture and turn it into a very big pile of money, is clearly on the rise and MIPS, not so much. Given the litigious nature of tech companies these days and sour grapes in general, it is far better for ARM to buy access to the patents than to try to fight a legal battle on one front with MIPS while fighting a tech battle with Intel on the other front.
